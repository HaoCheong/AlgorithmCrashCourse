# Algorithm Crash Course

Author: Hao Cheong

## Introduction

This repo contains a number of crash course helper notes for introducing and explaining algorithm concepts and (in my opinion) best practices in approaching a these sorts of questions. These notes were based of the UNSW COMP3121 21T2 iteration of the course.

*Do recognise that some of the terminology I used in the notes are based on what I believe were the best words to explain the concept and that my interpretation of the concepts. Take every term I use with a grain of salt*

## Topics 
### Main Topics
- **Time Complexity:** Big O and common helpful algorithms
- **Divide and Conquer:** Themes and methodology of approaching questions
- **Greedy Method:** Greedy procedure, mindset, worked out steps
- **Dynamic Programming:** Dynammic Programming, understanding recusive method

### Side topics
- **Quick Tips:** Helpful "quick" guide summarising the important aspects as well as practical advice on approaching the questions.
- **Questions Walkthrough:** (In Progress)

## Conclusion:
I hope whoever finds this to be useful when tackling these problems and good luck on any algorithm endeavours you may have!
